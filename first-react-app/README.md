# First React App

This project serves as my introduction to React. It follows the tutorial from the YouTube video [React Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=KpwAtnTqztf_AV_5) by [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh).

Here, I am using React with TypeScript and Vite. 

It features:

- Creating a React App
- Creating a React Component
- React Ecosystem
- Fragments
- Conditional Rendering
- Event Handling
- State Management

Happy coding!
